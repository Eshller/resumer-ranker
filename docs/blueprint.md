## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of intelligence, formality, and efficiency. The overall scheme will be dark.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#29292b), a desaturated version of the indigo primary.
- Accent color: Violet (#8F00FF) to create contrast and highlight key elements, such as the 'Start Screening' button or matched skills.
- Body text: 'Inter', sans-serif. Headline Text: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif
- A clean, single-page layout, dividing the screen into an upload/input section and a results dashboard. Use clear, intuitive placement for elements to ensure ease of use.
- Simple, professional icons for actions like 'view' and 'download', aligning with a modern UI aesthetic. Preferably outline icons to provide a cleaner interface.
- Subtle animations, such as a progress bar during screening and smooth transitions when sorting or displaying results. This will provide the user feedback and engagement.
